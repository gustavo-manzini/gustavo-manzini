### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Gustavo**](https://www.miraya.tech), a frontend design engineer based in Uruguay.

I love turning design ideas into lightning-fast, accessible interfaces that feel effortless.

Outside of code and Figma, you’ll find me listening to music, playing videogames or drawing.  and consuming tech videos about new tecnologies(i am always learning).

#### Fun Facts:

* I love vegetables.
* Demon Slayer is my favorite anime.
